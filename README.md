# PerceptonLearningAlgoritmWIthMachineLearning
A study on different methods of classification with machine learning(Linear Regression, Classification methods like KKN, etc)

In this question, you will implement the perceptron learning algorithm ("PLA") for a linearly separable dataset. In your starter code, you will find input1.csv, containing a series of data points. Each point is a comma-separated ordered triple, representing feature_1, feature_2, and the label for the point. You can think of the values of the features as the x- and y-coordinates of each point. The label takes on a value of positive or negative one. You can think of the label as separating the points into two categories.
